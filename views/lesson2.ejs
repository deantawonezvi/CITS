            C Programs</div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                Every full C program begins inside a function called <b>"main()"</b>.<br>
                A function is simply a collection of commands that do <b>"something"</b>.
                <u><b>The main function is always called when the program first executes.</b></u><br>
                From main, we can call other functions, whether they be written by us or by others or use built-in language features.<br>
                To access the standard functions that comes with your compiler, you need to include a header with the #include directive.
                What this does is effectively take everything in the header and paste it into your program.<br><br>
                Let's look at a working program :
                <div id="editor" style="width:400px; height:120px; margin-left: 375px;">#include &lt stdio.h &gt
int main()
{
printf( "I am alive!  Beware.\n" );
getchar();
return 0;
}
                </div>
